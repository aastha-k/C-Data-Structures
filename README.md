# Data-Structures-in-CPP

This repository contains various data structures and algorithms implemented in C++. I have implemented them and often use them in various projects as well as in competitive programming questions. Most of them follow the classical functionality as described in most data structure textbooks. For a few data structures, I have added or removed or modified certain functions as per convenience. I have programmed them in an object oriented fashion to increase their reusability and flexibility.

The following data structures have been implemented:
- Vector
- Stack (using vector)
- Stack (using linked list)
- Linked List
- Queue
- Max Heap
- Priority Queue
- Graph (With DFS and BFS functions)
- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree
- AVL Tree
- Quick Sort
